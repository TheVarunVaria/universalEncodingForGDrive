# universalEncodingForGDrive
Python code for Universal Encoding for accessing zipped files on Google Drive


To access the google drive, you need to turn on the Drive API. Currently I access the CLIENT CONFIGURATION file using https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python?authuser=0 url.


By clicking on "Enable Drive API" button, a json file is downloaded, you have to rename the file as "credentials.json".

pip install pydrive
